# **Battleship**

## Overview
This fun Java program simulates a full game of Battleship. At the start, each player sets up their five ships. Afterwards, they take turns clicking on cells on their opponent's ocean area, attempting to sink all five ships. This was made my senior year of high school.

## Demonstration

### Setup
Players place their ships on the grid and the application checks that all places are valid.

### Gameplay
During each round, players click on their opponent's grid (above their personal grid) to attack a cell in the ocean. They receive feedback regarding whether or not they hit a ship and their opponent's grid is updated to help them keep track of which cells they have hit.

## UML Diagram
The assignment required a UML diagram, so I've included it below:

## Acknowledgements
Thank you to Mrs. Cynthia Gallatin of Plano Senior for her wonderful introduction to computer science class and the final project assignment that led to this program. The Plano CS program is lucky to have you.
